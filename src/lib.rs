//! The cee-scape crate provides access to `setjmp` and `sigsetjmp`
//! functionality, via an interface that ensures LLVM won't miscompile things.
//!
//! # Example usage
//!
//! The main intention is for this interface to be used with C code that expects
//! to longjmp via jump buffers established at Rust-to-C FFI boundaries.
//!
//! Here is an example, where we are using `extern "C"` functions as stand-ins
//! for the code you would normally expect to find in an external C library.
//!
//! ```rust
//! mod pretend_this_comes_from_c {
//!     use cee_scape::JmpBuf;
//!
//!     // Returns sum of a and b, but longjmps through `env` if either argument
//!     // is negative (passing 1) or if the sum overflows (passing 2).
//!     pub extern "C" fn careful_sum(env: JmpBuf, a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
//!         check_values(env, a, b);
//!         return a + b;
//!     }
//!
//!     extern "C" fn check_values(env: JmpBuf, a: i32, b: i32) {
//!         use cee_scape::longjmp;
//!         if a < 0 || b < 0 { unsafe { longjmp(env, -1); } }
//!         if (i32::MAX - a) < b { unsafe { longjmp(env, -2); } }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! use pretend_this_comes_from_c::careful_sum as sum;
//! use cee_scape::call_with_setjmp;
//!
//! assert_eq!(call_with_setjmp(|env| { sum(env, 10, 20) + 1000 }), 1030);
//! assert_eq!(call_with_setjmp(|env| { sum(env, -10, 20) + 1000 }), -1);
//! assert_eq!(call_with_setjmp(|env| { sum(env, 10, -20) + 1000 }), -1);
//! assert_eq!(call_with_setjmp(|env| { sum(env, i32::MAX, 1) + 1000 }), -2);
//! ```
//!
//! # Background on `setjmp` and `longjmp`.
//!
//! The `setjmp` and `longjmp` functions in C are used as the basis for
//! "non-local jumps", also known as "escape continuations". It is a way to have
//! a chain of calls "`entry` calls `middle_1` calls `middle_2` calls
//! `innermost`", where the bodies of `middle_1` or `middle_2` or `innermost`
//! might at some point decide that they want to jump all the way back to
//! `entry` without having to pass through the remaining code that they would
//! normally have to execute when returning via each of their respective
//! callers.
//!
//! In C, this is done by having `entry` first call `setjmp` to initialize a
//! jump enviroment (which would hold, for example, the current stack pointer
//! and, if present, the current frame pointer), and then passing a pointer to
//! that jump environment along during each of the child subroutines of A. If at
//! any point a child subroutine wants to jump back to the point where `setjmp`
//! had first returned, that child subroutine invoke `longjmp`, which reestablishes
//! the stack to the position it had when `setjmp` had originally returned.
//!
//! # Safety (or lack thereof)
//!
//! This crate cannot ensure that the usual Rust control-flow rules are upheld,
//! which means that the act of actually doing a longjmp/siglongjmp to a
//! non-local jump environment (aka continuation) is *unsafe*.
//!
//! For example, several Rust API's rely on an assumption that they will always
//! run some specific cleanup code after a callback is done. Such cleanup is
//! sometimes encoded as a Rust destructor, but it can also just be directly
//! encoded as straight-line code waiting to be run.
//!
//! Calls to `longjmp` blatantly break these assumptions. A `longjmp` invocation
//! does not invoke any Rust destructors, and it does not "unwind the stack".
//! All pending cleanup code between the `longjmp` invocation and the target
//! jump environment (i.e. the place where the relevant `setjmp` first returned)
//! is skipped.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//! // This emulates a data structure that has an ongoing invariant:
//! // the `depth` is incremented/decremented according to entry/exit
//! // to a given callback (see `DepthTracker::enter` below).
//! pub struct DepthTracker { depth: Cell<usize>, }
//!
//! let track = DepthTracker::new();
//! cee_scape::call_with_setjmp(|env| {
//!     track.enter(|| {
//!         // This is what we expect: depth is larger in context of
//!         // DepthTracker::enter callback
//!         assert_eq!(track.depth(), 1);
//!         "normal case"
//!     });
//!     0
//! });
//!
//! // Normal case: the tracked depth has returned to zero.
//! assert_eq!(track.depth(), 0);
//!
//! assert_eq!(cee_scape::call_with_setjmp(|env| {
//!     track.enter(|| {
//!         // This is what we expect: depth is larger in context of
//!         // DepthTracker::enter callback
//!         assert_eq!(track.depth(), 1);
//!         // DIFFERENT: Now we bypass the DepthTracker's cleanup code.
//!         unsafe { cee_scape::longjmp(env, 4) }
//!         "abnormal case"
//!     });
//!     0
//! }), 4);
//!
//! // This is the "surprise" due to the DIFFERENT line: longjmp skipped
//! // over the decrement from returning from the callback, and so the count
//! // is not consistent with what the data structure expects.
//! assert_eq!(track.depth(), 1 /* not 0 */);
//!
//! // (These are just support routines for the `DepthTracker` above.)
//! impl DepthTracker {
//!     pub fn depth(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.depth.get()
//!     }
//!     pub fn enter<X>(&self, callback: impl FnOnce() -> X) -> X {
//!         self.update(|x|x+1);
//!         let ret = callback();
//!         self.update(|x|x-1);
//!         ret
//!     }
//!     fn update(&self, effect: impl Fn(usize) -> usize) {
//!         self.depth.set(effect(self.depth.get()));
//!     }
//!     pub fn new() -> Self {
//!         DepthTracker { depth: Cell::new(0) }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In short, the `longjmp` routine is a blunt instrument. When a `longjmp`
//! invocation skips some cleanup code, the compiler cannot know whether
//! skipping that cleanup code was exactly what the program author intended, or
//! if it represents a programming error.
//!
//! Furthermore, much cleanup code of this form is enforcing *Rust safety
//! invariants*. This is why `longjmp` is provided here as an *unsafe* method;
//! that is a reminder that while one can invoke `call_with_setjmp` safely, the
//! obligation remains to audit whether any invocations of `longjmp` on the
//! provided jump environment are breaking those safety invariants by skipping
//! over such cleanup code.
//!
//! # Some static checking
//!
//! While not all of Rust's safety rules are statically enforced, one important
//! one is enforced: When invoking `call_with_setjmp`, the saved jump
//! environment is not allowed to escape the scope of the callback that is fed
//! to `call_with_setjmp`:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! let mut escaped = None;
//! cee_scape::call_with_setjmp(|env| {
//!     // If `env` were allowed to escape...
//!     escaped = Some(env);
//!     0
//! });
//! // ... it would be bad if we could then do this with it.
//! unsafe { cee_scape::longjmp(escaped.unwrap(), 1); }
//! ```
//!
//! We also cannot share jump environments across threads, because it is
//! undefined behavior to `longjmp` via a jump environments that was initialized
//! by a call to `setjmp` in a different thread.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! cee_scape::call_with_setjmp(move |env| {
//!     std::thread::scope(|s| {
//!         s.spawn(move || {
//!             unsafe { cee_scape::longjmp(env, 1); }
//!         });
//!         0
//!     })
//! });
//! ```
